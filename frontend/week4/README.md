Exercise 2 - JavaScript

Create a web page where the user on a form enters a person's name, length in cm and weight in kg and calculates and prints the person's BMI and weight type.

bmi = weight in kg / length in meters 2

weight Type:

underweight, if bmi <20

normal weight, about bmi 20 - 30

overweight, if bmi> 30

The printout should be written as:

Person's name, BMI = xxx.xx, weight type = xxxxx.

Built-in input control that allows only lengths between 100 and 250 and only weights between 30 and 300. If the weight is incorrect, an error message "invalid weight" is printed. If the length is incorrect, an "invalid length" error message is printed.
